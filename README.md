# Pavers React Developer Applicaton Form V1.0

**Live Version:** [https://tender-noether-a94d5c.netlify.app/](https://tender-noether-a94d5c.netlify.app/)

This is my first attempt, optimistically codenamed "Let's just get the damn thing to work shall we?" for the Pavers React developer challenge.

## What is it?

The spec is as follows:

"You will design a React.JS web application that will be a simple input form that upon completion, submits data to a RESTful API. This input form shall be known as the “Pavers React Developer Application Form”. This web-based application form will give candidates the ability the enter details about themselves that will support their application for the role of React Developer at Pavers.

The form will contain the following mandatory (M) and optional (O) fields:

- Name (M) Text field
- Email address (M) Text field
- Date of Application (M) Date field
- About you (M) Text field
- Reason for applying (M) Text field
- What do you know about Pavers Ltd? (M) Text field
- Picture of candidate (O) File upload"
